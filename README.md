# Desktop-Assistant
 Like Microsoft Cortana we've created our own virtual desktop assistant only for Government College of Engineering Chandrapur (GCOEC) using python which is suitable to run on any windows operating systems. We use python as a programming language because it has a multitude of libraries which can be used to create Artificial Intelligence.
